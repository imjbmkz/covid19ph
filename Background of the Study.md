# Purpose
This study aims to get the satisfaction of the Metro Manila residents on the actions taken and with the assistance given by the government in the national, local, and barangay levels in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also took the chance to get the residents' personal assessment on how safe they are living the "new normal" with all of the policies imposed on different levels of the government.

The questions included in this survey are as follow. The survey also included questions on respondents' demographics, such as, age, gender, and city residence.
1. How satisfied are you with the responses by the government in national, local, and barangay levels against the spread of COVID-19?
2. How satisfied are you with the assistance given by the government in national, local, and barangay levels during quarantine and/or lockdown?
3. How safe do you feel living the "new normal" given the policies of the government in all levels?

### Who is your intended audience?
The government in the national, local, and barangay levels is the intended audience of the findings of this study. The news, stating how the government fought with the pandemic, only tells the story on the government's perspective without putting  the people's assessment as to how effective and reasonable their policies are. This brief study was conducted to quickly pulse the residents' overall feedback on the policies mandated and assistance provided by the government in all levels.

Metro Manila residents are the intended respondents of the survey for this study. A respondent is considered a resident when they lived within NCR for the past five years, or had lived within NCR during quarantine period. This study acquired 102 responses and it was done via Microsoft Forms[1]. With the population of more than 13 million[2], this number of respondents gives us
Â±10% margin of error[3]. In addition, simple random sampling was conducted in this study which means that the number of respondents are not equally distributed among Metro Manila cities. Hence, a city or municipal level of checking residents' satisfaction is not a scope of this study.

### What data, insight, or finding you wish to share?
A simple understanding of people's high-level sentiment on what has been done by the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19, how satisfied they were with the assistance given by the government, and with how safe they think they are living their normal lives during the time of pandemic with all of the policies imposed is the main story the I want to share to everyone.

Personally, I want the government to think differently. This time, I want them to focus on what the people really think about the processes in place. I want the government to really be careful and to put into consideration all of the sentiments of the Filipino people everytime they implementa protocol, set aside any political concerns, and most importantly, ensure integrity within all aspects of the government. This study won't give any comprehensive findings on people's sentiments but just an overview of what the people feel, at least for those within NCR.

### How will you want people to act?
For the government, as mentioned before, I want them to have a different point of view on working to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to continue helping those badly affected by the pandemic. In addition, perhaps they could scrutinize every processes and policies in place to ensure that for every scenario, flattening the curve is prioritized.

### Hypothesis
Findings may vary based on location. It's highly suggested to have a systematic random sampling to gather enough responses from different cities.
